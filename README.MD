# AudioPatch

**AudioPatch** is a repository that hosts mostly Pd abstraction and some Max/MSP ones.

Note that most of the Pd work was done using [PlugData](https://plugdata.org/) and so, they may not be compatible with Pd-Vanilla.

Also note that many of these abstractions are not heavily tested. Use them with careful testing.
